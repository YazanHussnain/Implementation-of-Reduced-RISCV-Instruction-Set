# Implementation-of-Reduced-RISCV-Instruction-Set
A Single-Cycle Implementation of the Datapath and Controller for a Reduced RISC-V Instruction Set with Seven Segment Display

In this project I desgined a Datapath and Controller for RISCV Reduced Instruction set.
The instruction-type I implemented are: R-type, I-type, B-type and J-type.
# R-type
ADD
SUB
SLT
SLTU
OR
XOR
AND

# I-type
ADDI
ANDI
ORI
SLTI

# J-type
Jump And Link (JAL)

# B-type
Branch Equal (BEQ)
Branch Not Equal (BNE)

Two more instruction are implement which are:
Store Word (SW)
Load Word (LW)

# Instruction Memory
The instruction implemented using this processor is Greatest Common Divisor(GCD)
